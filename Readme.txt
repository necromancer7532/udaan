The index.html file has to be opened using a browser but since its a Php backend an apache server has to be running
I used and recommend using xampp and putting the entire folder in htdocs and then going to localhost to find the index page
following steps:
1.Start an apache server using xampp
2.in the xampp folder under htdocs save the entire folder
3.open browser and type localhost
4.click on udaan-necromancer7532
5.type the string and press search
